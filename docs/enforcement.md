# Enforcement

Enforcement turns a requirement into an invariant by detection. A bullet
carries it as a chokepoint (`protects:` and `chokepoint:`) or a
totality oracle (`over:` and `via:`).

```sh
node src/cli.ts run [--session <id> --agent <name>]   # both passes, one run appended
node src/cli.ts run --status                           # the latest verdict per enforcement
node src/cli.ts refute <component>/<name> --broke "…"  # the totality oracle with the break staged; it must fail
node src/cli.ts serve                                  # the warm language server, foreground
```

## The seam

The language adapter answers exactly the questions enforcement asks:
resolve a spec name to a definition; list every reference to it; say
whether the language enforces visibility and whether the thing is visible
outside its module; turn a `via` value into a test filter; and refute by
opening a synthetic reference.

A name resolves as a bare symbol (`writeClass`), a symbol in its file
(`KERNEL_WRITE_POLICY in policy.ts`), or a module path. Prose does not
resolve, and the check says so.

The first adapter drives `typescript-language-server` over the language
server protocol on stdio. Exportedness is not in the protocol, so the
adapter reads the declaration text. The second drives `pyright-langserver`
the same way; a package folder (`posthog/query_cache/`) resolves as a
module through its `__init__.py`.

## The ladder

Every reference to the protected thing is classified: inside the chokepoint
(the chokepoint symbol's range, or its module when the chokepoint is a
module), a test reference (reported, never a bypass), or a bypass. There is
no fourth class: every site the language server reports is a reference, an
import or re-export specifier included.

Two of those sites the language gives a form, and the form decides before
the range does (ruling `d-7abd1ba8`):

- A **plain import specifier** — type-only and namespace imports included —
  is **inside** when it sits in the chokepoint's own module. That one
  location is how the chokepoint reaches the thing, not a place the thing is
  used. The same import in any other module is a bypass.
- An **export-from specifier** or a **wildcard re-export** is a **bypass**
  wherever it stands, the chokepoint's own module included: it widens the
  thing's reach with no call at all.

Python's equivalents: `from x import y` or `import x` at the top of the
chokepoint's module is inside; the same import elsewhere is a bypass; an
import whose name the module's `__all__` lists is a re-export, and so is a
bare `from x import *`.

The adapter reads the form forward from the top-level statement the site
sits in, never backward for a terminator — the reading the dissolved import
heuristic could not make, which is why a bypass beneath a semicolon-less
bare import still grades broken. Neither language server reports a site for
a wildcard re-export (`export * from`, `from x import *`), so each adapter
scans its own source files for one, once per forget.

- **visibility-choked**: not visible outside its module, no bypass.
- **reference-choked**: visible, but every reference is inside the chokepoint.
- **broken**: a bypass exists, or the chokepoint cannot be resolved. A
  structural defect; each bypass names file, line, and referencing symbol.
- **not chokeable**: the protected thing is not a symbol or a module; the
  totality oracle form is the compromise.

The rungs are adapter-defined, each a fact the adapter verifies, and the
grade names who enforces it. TypeScript enforces visibility, so its top is
visibility-choked (the compiler). Python's ladder is in its own section
below.

## Refutation

Refutation is required **per enforcement**: a bullet carrying both forms
needs both.

A chokepoint refutes itself, and how it does depends on who enforces the
rung it earned.

**Coherence's own check is the enforcer.** The adapter stages the two
synthetic sites the import ruling could otherwise swallow, in one unsaved
pass: a use of the protected thing in the chokepoint's own module past the
chokepoint's range, and a re-export of it from a document beside it.
Nothing touches disk. The check then classifies each staged site with the
same function every other site goes through, and the refutation fires only
when it calls **every one** a bypass. A site the instrument could not see,
or one the check would call `inside` (the chokepoint covers everywhere the
language lets the thing be named) or `test` (the protected thing lives under
a test folder, so nothing can ever be a bypass), makes the check vacuous:
the run says which site and why, records not run, and the bullet stays a
requirement. A chokepoint named as a module has no inside that lies outside
its own range, so only the re-export is staged there, and the account says
so.

**The language is the enforcer** (`visibility-choked` in TypeScript,
`closure-choked` in Python). Coherence's check can never be made to fire
there: the compiler refuses every import of a thing the module does not
export, and the interpreter refuses every import of a name that is not a
module attribute. So the adapter stages the synthetic outside reference and
asks the language server for the diagnostic on it. A diagnostic that says
the name is not exported or not accessible **is** the refutation, recorded
as `refused by the language` with the diagnostic's own text (ruling
`rs-e93ecdd6`). Demanding Coherence's own firing there would leave the
strongest rungs weaker than the one below them.

A totality oracle is refuted by hand, and the refutation is a recorded
event, never a sentence. While the break is staged:

```sh
node src/cli.ts refute src/enforcement/"run appended never rewritten" \
  --broke "replaced the append in appendRun with a whole-file write" \
  [--session <id> --agent <name>]
```

It runs that bullet's totality oracle, **requires it to fail**, and appends a
refutation record beside the runs (kind `refutation`: the bullet, what was
broken, the failing verdict and its reason, at, session, commit, dirty). A
passing totality oracle appends nothing and exits non-zero. Then restore the
code and run `run`: the refutation counts as witnessed only once a run at or
after the record finds the same totality oracle passing again — red with the break, green
without it. The bullet's `refuted:` line stays as the human account and may
name the record; the account alone never satisfies the requirement.

## Python

Python enforces no visibility, so its ladder has four rungs, each a fact
the adapter verifies, and the grade names the enforcer:

- **closure-choked** (the interpreter): the protected thing is a
  function-local inside the chokepoint's body, never a module attribute,
  so nothing outside can import or name it.
- **checker-choked** (a checker the project runs): the name is
  underscore-prefixed and `pyrightconfig.json` or pyproject
  `[tool.pyright]` makes `reportPrivateUsage` an error; or, for a
  protected module, an import-linter rule in `.importlinter` or
  `[tool.importlinter]` names it. A project on mypy has no such rule, and
  the evidence says so.
- **reference-choked** (Coherence's check at the edit and in CI): the top
  rung when neither holds.
- **convention** (nobody): the underscore prefix or `__all__` exclusion
  alone; evidence, and the rung a vacuous refutation drops to.

Pyright indexes the whole workspace and the adapter never narrows it: a
Python reference can sit in any file, so a narrower root or include list
only proves the absence of a bypass inside what it sees, and Pyright
ignores a settings-level include under a project config anyway. On
PostHog (19,693 files) enumeration takes 2 s and 350 MB, the first
references query 3 s, later ones 0.5 s. `workspace/symbol` is never used
(30 s, 3.5 GB there); a bare name resolves by a text scan, then
`documentSymbol`.

The totality oracle pass runs pytest with `--junitxml={out}` and
`testFilterForm: "pytest"`: names go to `-k` joined with `or`, and the
JUnit report (or pytest-json-report's JSON) maps back by test name.

## The run and its view

A run appends one line to `.coherence/runs/<session>.jsonl`: time, session,
agent, commit, and one entry per enforcement: form, verdict, grade,
refutation, bypasses, test references, files, latency, reason. The
refutation field takes one of four values: `automatic` (the check called
every staged synthetic site a bypass), `refused by the language` (the
compiler or the interpreter refused the synthetic outside reference),
`witnessed` (a refutation record for a totality oracle, with a later passing
run), and `missing`. A run with no `--invariant` and no `--form` filter
also carries `full: true`. Orient's note on the invariant floor counts only
those, and none dated after now. Nothing is
rewritten. `refute` appends its refutation records to the same files, marked
with `kind: "refutation"`.

A run exits non-zero when an enforcement failed and also when the instrument
was needed and could not answer: the totality pass runs the whole suite
before the first question, so the run holds the warm server's idle timer open
with a heartbeat and asks the instrument again afterwards. A run that proved
nothing must never read like a clean one.

`run --status` is a view: the latest entry per enforcement across every run;
one the latest run skipped keeps its prior dated verdict, and the line says
so. `spec --check` reads the same view: an automatic refutation or one
refused by the language satisfies a
chokepoint enforcement's refutation requirement, a refutation record with a
later passing run satisfies a totality oracle's, a passing verdict shows as
verified, and a failing one on a bullet that was otherwise complete makes it
a structural defect — an invariant whose satisfaction has been removed. A
requirement whose check is failing stays a requirement, reported with its
failing check. With no run, every enforcement is declared, unverified.

The totality oracle pass runs every test the bullets name in one invocation of the
config's `testJson` command (a combined name pattern, a per-test JSON
report) and maps results back by name; the record says so. One test per
invocation of `test` is the fallback when a runner cannot report per test.
Not configured is reported, never assumed passing. node:test ships no JSON
reporter, so `src/enforcement/node-test-reporter.ts` writes the jest-shaped
report from its events; Coherence's own config names it.

## Revelation at the edit

The warm server holds the language server open across hook invocations:
`serve` runs it in the foreground; a client connects over a unix socket
under `.coherence/run/` and spawns it detached when none listens; it shuts
down after a few idle minutes.

On PostToolUse for a file-writing tool, the hook re-checks only the
chokepoint invariants the file may involve (a prior run touched the file, or
a protected or chokepoint name appears in it) and appends the pass as a run. A bypass is printed as additionalContext in the same turn: the
invariant, the bypass site, and the two honest options, route the reference
through the chokepoint or escalate a retirement for a human. At Stop the
regulation message carries the structural defects the latest run left; at
SubagentStop one refuses the stop.
