/**
 * The prefilter over Coherence's own tree: the reading asked through the word

 * the prefilter on fixtures, one per escape hatch; this is the same
 * comparison on a real project, run in the bench job because it reads the
 * whole tree twice and so costs more with every merge.

 * usage: node bench/interfaces/own-tree.ts
