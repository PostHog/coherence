/**
 * Coherence's Claude Code mod, enabled for one person in one project.
 *
 * The mod (mods/coherence) answers Claude Code's hook events through one warm
 * process per session instead of a settings hook per event. Coherence's
 * repository is its marketplace (.claude-plugin/marketplace.json, one entry,
 * the mod's folder), and the mod runs the project's own installed Coherence,
 * so it is a forwarder that any project's version can sit behind: an event
 * the warm process cannot answer runs through `coherence hook` as a settings
 * hook would.
 *
 * Install is Claude Code's own: `claude plugin marketplace add
 * PostHog/coherence --scope local` and `claude plugin install
 * coherence@coherence --scope local`, which write the project's personal
 * settings (.claude/settings.local.json, never committed). The marketplace is
 * the repository, never a project's node_modules folder: Claude Code knows a
 * marketplace by its name on the whole machine, so a second project
 * registering its own folder would repoint the first project's mod at it.
 * Enabling is personal because the fast path is opt-in: teammates keep the
 * committed settings hooks until they choose the mod.
 *
 * The mod stands aside for every event whose settings hooks already run
 * Coherence, so install removes Coherence's hooks from the personal settings
 * and leaves the committed ones, which belong to the team, and says while
 * they remain that the mod answers no event they cover.
