/**
 * The vocabulary kept between readings, so an edit pays for the files it
 * names and never for the corpus.
 *
 * A full coverage reading (a session's start, a prompt over a moved tree, a
 * stop) keeps each file's contribution (lexicon-coverage.ts: the names it
 * nominates and where, the declared names it writes as words, the known
 * names it uses) and the totals they add up to, under
 * .coherence/cache/vocabulary, in a fixed number of buckets by file and by
 * term. An edit reads the files it wrote, and only those, scans them as the
 * reading would, and compares each with its kept contribution: a name whose
 * totals cross the threshold a candidate needs with this edit is named, and
 * a known name newly written where its sense is at risk is named. Then the
 * kept contributions and totals take the edit in, under a lock, once what
 * the edit named reached the host.
 *
 * What an edit reads is bounded: the files it wrote, one bucket per file,
 * and at most every term bucket, a fixed number. What it judges is the
 * totals as the last full reading left them plus every edit since; a file
 * changed without a hook seeing it counts as it was until the next full
 * reading, and so does a name whose recurrence rests on code the edit
 * newly declared and prose it never touched. A line that names both a term
 * and its plural counts twice here and once in a full reading. The kept
 * state is keyed by Coherence's code identity and by the lexicons and the
 * config's names: any change to either, and the edit takes a full reading,
 * which keeps the state again.
