/**
 * Hook wiring for a host, written into the project and never over anyone
 * else's hooks.
 *
 * Claude Code reads `.claude/settings.json`; Codex reads `.codex/hooks.json`.
 * Both use the same shape: `hooks -> EventName -> [{ matcher?, hooks: [{ type:
 * "command", command, timeout }] }]` (Claude Code: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks;
 * Codex: https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks). Install merges: an existing
 * entry for another command is kept; a command Coherence wrote earlier is
 * replaced, and only a command that names this tool's binary or its own cli
 * path counts as Coherence's; everything outside `hooks` is untouched. No
 * hook that is not ours is ever deleted.
 *
 * Uninstall is the same ownership rule run the other way: every command that
 * is ours leaves, and an entry, an event list, or a `hooks` object that this
 * removal emptied goes with it; everything else stays where it was. The check
 * compares what is installed with what install would write, event by event,
 * and names each drift: missing, stale, or an extra entry of ours. Install
 * and uninstall keep the file's indentation and final newline and write
 * nothing when nothing changed, so a round trip gives back the adopter's file.
 *
 * An adopter's hook finds Coherence rather than naming one path to it:
 * Coherence is the package in the project's node_modules, or a checkout run
 * from outside the project (never `npm link`ed in: that installed a second
 * dependency tree and broke a pnpm build). The command walks up to the
 * project root and looks, in order, at $COHERENCE_HOME, a `coherence` folder
 * beside the project, one beside the main checkout when the project is a git
 * worktree, the installed package's own cli, and last the project's
 * node_modules/.bin/coherence. The committed command names no one's absolute
 * path, so it is the same on every teammate's machine and the check agrees
 * across them. When nothing is found, or node is not on the PATH, the hook
 * prints one line as a systemMessage (both hosts show it to the user), exits
 * 0, and does nothing else.
 *
 * Install also writes `.coherence/.gitignore` once, so an adopter's git sees
 * only what Coherence keeps for good (the journal, runs and work orders, and
 * the project's own hook voice) and none of the state it regenerates. The
 * file sits inside Coherence's own folder, so install edits nothing the
 * adopter wrote; a file there with any other text is the adopter's and is
 * left alone. Uninstall removes it only when it is still exactly what
 * install wrote and no agent host keeps a hook of ours.
