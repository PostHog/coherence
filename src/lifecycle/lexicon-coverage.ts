/**
 * Vocabulary coverage: a reproducible reading of observed uses, not a claim
 * about every word's meaning, and never a count to act on. What it hands a
 * reader is a short ranked signal: the recurring terms that lack a definition
 * and the uses whose sense is at risk.
 *
 * Code and prose are different populations. From code, only declared and
 * exported names (and the fields of exported types) are candidate sources;
 * local identifiers, the words and
 * n-grams of split identifiers, strings, regular-expression fragments, paths,
 * ids, and punctuation-bearing tokens never are. From prose (docs, specs, and
 * the journal's and work's records), a candidate is a name written as a name:
 * Title Case away from a sentence start, a heading word, a single backticked
 * word. A candidate stands only when it recurs: a prose name on three lines,
 * or two across two components; a declared name where prose writes it as
 * words (never inside an identifier's spelling) on ten lines across four
 * components.
 * Well-known names (well-known.json, the config's wellKnown, the project's
 * own name), names the lexicon declares (concepts, aliases, instances,
 * properties, and its "not:" confusables), and general English and
 * programming words are never candidates. A common word written as a
 * project's proper noun still is; a function word (a preposition,
 * conjunction, determiner, pronoun, or auxiliary) never is, however written.
 *
 * Sense review is asked only where meaning is at risk: a name with more than
 * one recorded sense, a use on or beside a prose line carrying a name
 * rejected for that same concept, or a Coherence concept an adopter's code
 * declares with its own sense.
