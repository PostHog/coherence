/**
 * The work meter: a count of the expensive work one hook call does, kept in
 * process and scoped to that call, so a test can hold a hook to a number of
 * reads, spawns and readings where a timing would flake and would miss scale.
 *
 * What it counts, each at the one place that work passes:
 *   file read          a project file's content read for a reading: the
 *                      corpus (readCorpus), the spec model's spec, practice
 *                      and handler files, practice delivery's practice files,
 *                      the file an edit names (readProjectText)
 *   spawn              a child process or a worker thread, git or any other,
 *                      counted at node's child_process module itself,
 *                      whatever route reached it (below)
 *   project-sized spawn  a spawn whose cost grows with the project whatever
 *                      it prints: git listing, searching or comparing the
 *                      tree; any spawn through a shell, whose command line
 *                      cannot be read for what it runs; and a recursive tool
 *                      (grep -r, find, rg, ls -R, fd, du, tree)
 *   spawn output       the bytes a child wrote to its standard output, for
 *                      the synchronous forms and a promised execFile (a
 *                      streamed spawn, the language servers' and the warm
 *                      server's, is not counted)
 *   coverage reading   one vocabulary coverage reading (lexiconCoverage)
 *   spec model         one spec model load (loadSpecModel)
 *   server request     one request to a language server or to the warm
 *                      server (JsonRpcClient.request, LineClient.request)
 *   phrase comparison  one test of a line against one lexicon phrase in the
 *                      coverage scan, added once per reading
 *
 * Not counted here: a stat, a directory walk, a git listing's own length, and
 * Coherence's own state under .coherence (feed cursors, traces, the kept
 * parses and indexes, run records, the journal). The size tests count those
 * too, below the meter, at the file system (fs-count-fixture.ts), so a read
 * that slips past these doors still shows there.
 *
 * runHook opens the scope and closes it; a count outside any scope is one
 * comparison against undefined, so the meter costs nothing a hook can feel.

/**
 * Every spawn this process makes is counted at the one object every route to
 * a spawn reaches: node's child_process module itself. Its spawning functions
 * are replaced, once, at load, with counted ones, and syncBuiltinESMExports
 * carries the replacement to every module that imported them by name, so a
 * spawn through a static import, a dynamic import of a computed name,
 * process.getBuiltinModule, createRequire, code vm runs, or a third-party
 * module (execa spawns through child_process too) is counted alike. A worker
 * thread is counted as a spawn. A call one counted function makes of another
 * (exec runs execFile) counts once. A counted function carries every
 * property its original does, and its promisified form returns the
 * original's own promise, `.child` included, so nothing that calls it can
 * tell it from node's.
 *
 * The patch is installed at the CLI's first import, before any other module
 * loads (cli.ts), so no Coherence module and no library it loads can take
 * the spawning functions before they are counted. What stays uncounted, and
 * no test here can catch: a CommonJS module that captured spawnSync (or any
 * of them) by destructuring before this module ran, which only code loaded
 * ahead of the CLI can be; process.binding('spawn_sync') and node's other
 * internal bindings, which spawn below the module; and a native addon that
 * starts a process itself.
