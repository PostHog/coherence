/**
 * The CI check: Coherence run on every pull request by the project's CI
 * host, in one of two modes. `fail` fails the check on a spec problem or a
 * structural defect; `comment` never fails on findings, only when Coherence
 * itself did not finish, and posts one report comment on the pull request,
 * updated in place on every push (ci-report.ts builds it).
 *
 *   coherence ci install --host github --mode fail|comment [--write]
 *   coherence ci report --session <id>
 *
 * Install prints the workflow it would write, and with --write writes
 * .github/workflows/coherence.yml at the repository top; a file already
 * there is never overwritten, and install says so. The workflow is planned
 * from the tree: the lockfile names the package manager and where to
 * install, the registry (a top config with projects) puts the check at the
 * repository top so every listed project is covered, and a project nested
 * below the top runs there. The language servers come with the package's
 * optional dependencies, which the lockfile install brings.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches the network: the plan reads files, and the actions
 * the workflow uses are pinned by commit as Coherence's own CI pins them.
