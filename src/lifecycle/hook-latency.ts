/**
 * What the hooks cost the session they serve, against the latency budget.
 *
 * A tool hook runs before and after every tool call, so its time is paid
 * over and over, and a call cycle that feels sluggish is how Coherence gets
 * switched off. Each hook call's time is kept, from its process's start, so
 * loading the code counts as the user waits for it, under
 * .coherence/hook-times/<session>.jsonl, transient like the feed cursors. A tool
 * hook over the budget says so in its own answer; regulate names the
 * session's calls over it, and orient the last week's.
