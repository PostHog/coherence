/**
 * The two files Coherence keeps for git inside its own folder, so a project
 * commits its records and nothing else of Coherence's, and merges them
 * without a conflict. Both sit in .coherence, so writing them never edits a
 * file the adopter wrote, and their patterns are relative to that folder.
 *
 * `.coherence/.gitignore` keeps out the state Coherence regenerates. Install
 * writes it once; a file holding exactly what an earlier release wrote is
 * Coherence's and is brought up to this one's text; any other text is the
 * adopter's and is left alone.
 *
 * `.coherence/.gitattributes` makes each record store's session files merge
 * with the union of both sides' lines (merge=union): two branches that
 * appended to one session's file, as every stacked branch does, merge and
 * rebase cleanly, and every record of both survives. The stores' readers
 * order records by their content, never by line, so the order the union
 * leaves is no one's concern. It also marks the stores generated, so GitHub
 * folds them in a pull request's diff. Install and every session start
 * write it, so a project that adopted an earlier release has it from its
 * first session after the upgrade; a file already there keeps every line
 * the adopter wrote, and only an attribute it does not set for that pattern
 * is added.
