/**
 * The lexicon check: two questions asked of a corpus of prose, code, data,
 * and the journal's own records.
 *
 * REJECTED NAME: a name some concept refused, appearing as a whole word or
 * phrase in prose, as a whole identifier token (camelCase and snake_case
 * split) in code, or as a key or value in a data file. Each finding carries
 * the concept and its because.
 *
 * UNKNOWN NOUN: a term prose uses as a name (backticked, Title Case away from
 * a sentence start, or the name of a component folder) that no lexicon
 * declares, is not a common word, and appears at least twice. Precision over
 * recall: every finding is meant to be acted on with one of three answers,
 * declare it, map it, or fix it.
 *
 * Whose names bind where. Coherence's rejected names bind only where
 * Coherence's concepts are named. In Coherence's own repository that is
 * everywhere, prose, code, data and records alike, as strictly as ever. In
 * an adopter, the project's code and domain prose are the project's words
 * and Coherence's names are never matched there: a word the tool refused for
 * one of its own concepts is an ordinary word of someone else's domain. Only
 * the text written to Coherence (the journal's and work's records, a spec's
 * grammar, which is its section headings, property keys and checklist shapes
 * with their state words, and coherence.config.json) is matched, and there a
 * hit is advisory: reported as a count, never failing, since a record may
 * name the domain's thing in the domain's sense. The project's own lexicon's
 * rejected names bind in
 * everything the project writes, prose and identifiers alike, because a
 * rejected name in an identifier is the drift the lexicon exists to catch.
 *
 * A project CLAIMS a word by declaring it in its own lexicon (a concept,
 * alias, or instance): a Coherence rejected name it declares is not a
 * finding there in any text, and a hit inside a longer accepted phrase (a
 * project alias that happens to contain a rejected word) is not a hit.
 *
 * The findings a project held when it adopted Coherence are its BASELINE
 * (lexicon-baseline.ts): counted on one line, never failing, and never
 * allowed to grow. Coherence's own repository keeps none.
 *
 * The corpus is every text file kind a project holds, the journal's records
 * included, and never the files written in another vocabulary on purpose:
 * the lexicons themselves, the retired inventories, docs/reference, and
 * the adversarial reviews, which quote the names they report. It stays inside
 * the config's bounds: a folder the ignore list names is never entered, by
 * the same rule every other walk applies, so an adoption bounded to one
 * subsystem of a monorepo reads that subsystem and its records. A path the
 * check cannot read is reported as unreadable and skipped; it never aborts
 * the walk. Every path given is confined to the project root.
