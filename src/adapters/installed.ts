/**
 * Where an installed package is, asked of Node's package resolver and never
 * spelled as a path: the language servers both adapters start and the
 * tsserver the TypeScript one drives. Under pnpm, Coherence's own
 * dependencies sit beside its package in the store, not inside it, so a path
 * built as <Coherence>/node_modules/<package> names nothing; the resolver,
 * asked from a file of Coherence's own, finds them wherever the package
 * manager put them. A package's exports map can refuse a subpath (TypeScript
 * 7 exports no lib/tsserver.js), so a package's folder is found by its
 * manifest, through the folders the resolver's own lookup walks, and a file
 * inside it is read from there.
 *
 * This module is the one place an adapter learns where a package is
 * (Adapters.spec.md, "packages found by the resolver").
