/**
 * The project's config as every reader sees it: its own
 * `coherence.config.json`, over what a repository-level registry declares.
 *
 * A `coherence.config.json` at the repository top that carries `projects`, a
 * list of repository-relative folders, is a registry: the top is no project
 * of its own, each listed folder (a leaf) is one, and the rest of the
 * repository is outside every project. A leaf inherits the registry's keys
 * unless its own config declares them, key by key:
 *
 *   name, entryDir, lexicon, projects   never inherited: each is the leaf's own
 *   ignore      concatenated: the registry's names apply anywhere, and a path
 *               it names is kept when it lies inside the leaf, rebased to it
 *   wellKnown   concatenated
 *   tests, test, testJson, testMatch, testFilterForm, testDir, testDirs
 *               one group: a leaf that declares any of them replaces the
 *               registry's whole group, so a leaf's command never runs with
 *               the registry's match; an inherited setup's cwd is rebased
 *               from the registry's folder to the leaf (the registry's "."
 *               is the repository top)
 *   everything else (language, references, latencyBudget, interfaceBudget,
 *               and any key not named here)   replaced whole
 *
 * A relative path an inherited key holds resolves against the file that
 * declared it. `references` folders are relative to the repository top in
 * either file, which is where the registry sits.
 *
 * Without a registry, a project's config is its own file, as before.
