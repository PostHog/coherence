/**
 * The project's own files: the one rule for what may ever be evidence.
 *
 * A file belongs to the project when git would call it the project's — it
 * is tracked, or untracked and not ignored (`git ls-files --cached --others
 * --exclude-standard`) — and it does not lie inside a nested checkout: a
 * folder below the root holding a `.git` file or folder, which is another
 * repository or another worktree of this one (an agent's copy under
 * `.claude/worktrees/`, a vendored clone, a submodule). Git alone does not
 * settle the second half: a `.git` file whose gitdir it cannot follow makes
 * the folder read as ordinary untracked files, so the nesting is checked on
 * disk as well. Outside a repository there are no ignore rules to read, so
 * every file under the root that no nested checkout holds belongs, except
 * under node_modules, the one dependency folder assumed ignored everywhere.
 *
 * Every walk of the project and every reference an instrument reports goes
 * through this rule: a copy of a file in an agent's worktree is someone
 * else's working state, and a reference found there is not a reference in
 * this project, so it is never a bypass, never vocabulary, never mass.
