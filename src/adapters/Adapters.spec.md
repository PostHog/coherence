# Adapters

The language adapter seam: how to ask a language's server for definitions, references, visibility, a test filter, and a synthetic refutation.

## invariants
- name forms: A spec value reads as a bare symbol, a symbol in its file, or a module path that stays under the project root, and prose never resolves; one function decides the form.
  protects: IDENTIFIER in adapter.ts
  chokepoint: parseName
  over: every value a spec writes under protects, chokepoint, or as a module path
  via: a spec value reads as a bare symbol, a symbol in a file, a module path, or prose
  because: fourteen of the reference's sixteen chokepoint claims had prose where the protected thing belongs and stood green for months; a value that does not read as a symbol or a module must be refused as prose by one function before any instrument is asked, so a claim about nothing cannot pass. Spec text is agent-authored and never trusted about itself, so a path with a parent segment or a leading slash is prose too: the module form accepted "..", and a spec could name a file above the project root for the tool to read
  crossing: project-source -> instrument
  refuted: made parseName read prose as a bare symbol -> "a spec value reads as a bare symbol, a symbol in a file, a module path, or prose" went red in adapter.test.ts; restored, green (2026-09-17)
  kinds: none
- current text before any question: Before any references query, the adapter makes the language server see the current disk text of every document it may have open and of every file the caller names, and waits for the server to acknowledge it.
  over: every document either adapter has open and every file a forget names
  via: the check reads the current disk text after a forget, with the instrument's watcher blind to the file: a loop of edit-then-check yields zero wrong verdicts
  because: tsserver reloads a closed document from disk only when it does not own the text, and a didOpen carrying the text it already loaded leaves it owning that text, so closing the document leaves the edit to a file watcher that is late under load and blind to an excluded file; both reviewers saw the check answer from pre-edit text and a pass recorded with a bypass on disk, the one answer revelation at the edit must never give
  crossing: project-source -> instrument
  refuted: left an open document to the file watcher on forget, as the adapter did before -> "the check reads the current disk text after a forget, with the instrument's watcher blind to the file: a loop of edit-then-check yields zero wrong verdicts" went red in enforcement.test.ts with two of six verdicts answered from pre-edit text; restored, green (2026-09-18)
  kinds: none
- every site is a reference: Every site the language server reports for the protected thing is a reference, an import or re-export specifier included; the adapter reports the syntactic form it read at the site and never exempts one, and the check alone decides what the form means.
  over: every reference site either adapter reports, import and export specifiers included
  via: every site the language server reports is a reference: a bypass beneath a semicolon-less bare import is a bypass, and an import outside the chokepoint is one too
  because: an import of the protected thing outside the chokepoint reaches it and a re-export widens its reach with no call at all, so neither is exempt; the heuristic that told an import from a use called every site beneath a semicolon-less bare import an import, and a real bypass graded clean (decision d-0da89a08 dissolved the exemption rather than patch the parser). Ruling d-7abd1ba8 gives one form one meaning at one location, and the adapter still exempts nothing: it reads the form forward from the top-level statement the site sits in, which is the reading the dissolved heuristic could not make, and hands it to the check
  crossing: instrument -> reading
  refuted: exempted import specifiers from the classification, as the adapter did before -> "every site the language server reports is a reference: a bypass beneath a semicolon-less bare import is a bypass, and an import outside the chokepoint is one too" went red in enforcement.test.ts with the bypass graded pass; restored, green (2026-09-18)
  kinds: none
- test paths: A path is a test when a configured folder is one of its segments or the file is named .test or .spec.
  over: every configured test folder and every file named .test or .spec
  via: a path is a test when a configured folder is a segment or the file is named .test or .spec
  because: a test may reference a protected thing to check it and is reported rather than counted as a bypass; the rule is the config's folders plus the file naming both runners use, so a test in an unexpected folder is still a test
  crossing: project-source -> reading
  refuted: made a configured test folder no longer mark a path as a test -> "a path is a test when a configured folder is a segment or the file is named .test or .spec" went red in adapter.test.ts; restored, green (2026-09-17)
  kinds: none
- ladder is adapter-defined: The grade ladder is the adapter's to name, rung by rung, each rung a fact the adapter verifies and the name of who enforces it: TypeScript's compiler reaches visibility-choked; Python's interpreter reaches closure-choked, a checker the project runs checker-choked, Coherence's own check reference-choked, and a convention alone is enforced by nobody.
  protects: TYPESCRIPT_LADDER
  chokepoint: TypeScriptAdapter
  over: every adapter
  via: the grade ladder's top rung is adapter-defined: TypeScript enforces visibility, Python does not
  because: visibility-choked means the language itself refuses a reference from outside the module; a language that enforces no visibility cannot earn it, and a ladder with one top for every language would grade a convention as a structural fact; naming the enforcer on every rung is what lets a human read how much the structure is doing and who would stop a bypass
  crossing: instrument -> reading
  refuted: raised the second adapter's top rung to visibility-choked -> the adapter-defined ladder test went red in adapter.test.ts; restored, green (2026-09-17); left whenVacuous unset on the Python ladder -> the same test went red; restored, green (2026-09-17)
  kinds: none
- Python rungs verified: A Python chokepoint is graded closure-choked only when the protected thing is a function-local inside the chokepoint's body and no module attribute exposes it, checker-choked only when the name is underscore-prefixed and the project's Pyright configuration makes reportPrivateUsage an error (or an import-linter rule names the protected module), and reference-choked otherwise, with the underscore prefix and the __all__ list reported as evidence.
  protects: PYTHON_LADDER
  chokepoint: PythonAdapter
  over: every rung of the Python ladder and every combination of definition scope, name prefix, __all__ membership, and checker configuration
  via: Python grades: broken with a bypass; reference-choked when clean, with the convention as evidence; closure-choked for a function-local; checker-choked once Pyright's private-usage rule is an error; broken without a chokepoint; not chokeable for prose
  because: each rung names an enforcer, so a rung granted without its fact would credit the interpreter or a checker with a refusal that does not happen; the adapter reads the definition's scope from Pyright's symbols and the checker's rule from the project's own configuration, never from the spec
  crossing: instrument -> reading
  refuted: made the closure rung never verified -> "Python grades: broken with a bypass; reference-choked when clean, with the convention as evidence; closure-choked for a function-local; checker-choked once Pyright's private-usage rule is an error; broken without a chokepoint; not chokeable for prose" went red in python.test.ts; restored, green (2026-09-17)
  kinds: none
- package files are inside the package: A site in one of a protected package's own files is inside the package, and every other site Pyright reports, an import line or an __all__ entry included, is a reference classified by where it sits.
  over: every reference site Pyright reports for a protected module or package
  via: a Python module or package resolves, its members are the references' start, and the package's own files are inside it
  because: a package re-exporting its own members from __init__ is the package reaching itself, so its own files are inside; an importer of a protected name outside the chokepoint reaches the thing and is a bypass, which is what the check exists to reveal
  crossing: instrument -> reading
  refuted: made a package's own files no longer inside the protected package -> "a Python module or package resolves, its members are the references' start, and the package's own files are inside it" went red in python.test.ts; restored, green (2026-09-17)
  kinds: none
- whole workspace indexed: The Python adapter waits for Pyright's enumeration of the whole workspace before answering, and never narrows the workspace to a component.
  over: every references query and every bare-name resolution the Python adapter answers
  via: Python waits for whole-workspace enumeration before bare-name resolution and references, and finds references outside the component
  because: a Python reference can sit in any project file, so a partial index cannot prove that no bypass exists; both references queries and bare-name resolutions wait for Pyright's source-file enumeration, and Pyright receives the project root as its root and workspace folder, so a component hint orders the text scan without narrowing the workspace
  crossing: instrument -> reading
  refuted: bypassed the enumeration barrier before every indexed query -> "Python waits for whole-workspace enumeration before bare-name resolution and references, and finds references outside the component" went red; restored, green (2026-09-18); narrowed Pyright initialization from the project root to one component -> the same test went red; restored, green (2026-09-18)
  kinds: none
- pytest report mapped by name: The batched totality pass reads pytest's JUnit XML or pytest-json-report's JSON as the one report shape, and writes pytest's name filter as a -k expression joined with or.
  protects: reportFromJunit
  chokepoint: parseReport
  over: every report the configured testJson command writes and every via a Python bullet names
  via: pytest's JUnit report reads as the jest shape, and -k names join with or
  because: pytest ships no jest-shaped reporter but writes JUnit XML itself; a name joined as a regex would be one -k expression pytest cannot parse, so no test would run and every Python totality oracle would fail for the wrong reason
  crossing: instrument -> record
  refuted: joined pytest names as a regex -> "pytest's JUnit report reads as the jest shape, and -k names join with or" went red in python.test.ts; restored, green (2026-09-17)
  kinds: none
- server located or a reason: The language server binary is found in the adopter's node_modules first, then Coherence's, then on PATH, and its absence is a reason, never a crash.
  protects: SERVER_BIN in typescript.ts
  chokepoint: src/adapters/typescript.ts
  over: the adopter's node_modules, Coherence's, and every folder on PATH
  via: the language server binary is found (the adapter's precondition)
  because: the language server is an optional dependency; an adopter without it must get a reason naming where the tool looked and how to install it, and a run must record not run rather than crash, since not run is a verdict the status view can show. The chokepoint's refutation is the compiler's own refusal of a synthetic import of SERVER_BIN, which its module does not export (ruling rs-e93ecdd6); the totality oracle was refuted by making locateServer answer before it looked anywhere, which is the absence branch staged inside the function rather than by taking the binary off the machine
  crossing: instrument -> reading
  refuted: made locateServer return undefined before it looked anywhere, so the adapter's precondition found no binary -> the totality oracle went red, then green once restored (2026-09-18)
  kinds: deploy
  checklist: graceful-drain dismissed: nothing is shut down by locating the binary
  checklist: readiness-evidence declared as server located or a reason
  checklist: declared-target-coverage dismissed: three places are looked in, in order; there is no registry of targets
- only the project's files: Only the project's own files are ever evidence: a file is the project's when git tracks it or lists it untracked and not ignored, and it lies inside no nested checkout; one function set decides it (projectFiles, keepProjectFiles, projectSites in project-files.ts), and every walk of the project and every reference an instrument reports passes through it.
  over: every walk of the project (the adapters' source scans, the spec walker, economy and mass, the vocabulary check's corpus, observation's path mapping, the changed-file listings) and every reference site accepted from an instrument (the adapters, the chokepoint check, the edit hook's re-check, the economy closure, the observed and Scope component interfaces)
  via: only the project's own files are ever evidence: a nested checkout and an ignored path are no bypass, no vocabulary, and no mass
  because: agents work in git worktrees under .claude/worktrees, inside the main checkout, and each worktree's copy of a file reads to a language server as more of the project; a reference in an agent's copy of verbs.ts graded attributed writes broken in the main checkout, the edit hook reported the same false bypasses to several agents, and the Structure map shown to reviewers carried the false broken (conjecture c-16d2f394, resolution rs-b4cf50f6). Git's own ignore rules already say what is not the project's, and a folder holding a .git is another checkout even when git cannot follow its gitdir, so both halves are one rule
  crossing: instrument -> reading
  kinds: none
- a folder is left out only by a named rule: Every walk of the project reads the project's files that one rule (exclusionOf in project-files.ts) leaves in, narrowed only by kind, and that rule leaves a folder out only for a reason it names: the config's ignore list, a host's folder, a hidden folder, a dependency install, an interpreter's cache, or a virtual environment; never for its name alone, and what it leaves out plus what it reads is exactly the project's files.
  over: every walker of the project (the spec walker, the economy's source files, both adapters' file walks, the Scope reading's bounds and entrance detection, the vocabulary check's corpus) over a project holding code in folders named public, dist and build beside a folder of each rule
  via: every walk reads what the one rule leaves in: a folder is left out only by a named rule, never by its name alone
  because: four walkers each kept a list of folder names never read, and the lists drifted; one held public, so an adoption's billing/api/public, five routes and a spec of its own, was read by no walk and nothing said so (df-c35c025e). A file a name list drops is silent: no bypass, no entrance, no mass, no vocabulary, and no reading names the gap. One rule with a reason for each file it leaves out makes the gap a printed line instead of an absence
  crossing: project-source -> reading
  refuted: left out every folder named public by its name alone, in folderReason -> "every walk reads what the one rule leaves in: a folder is left out only by a named rule, never by its name alone" went red in src/adapters/walks.test.ts; restored, green (2026-10-06)
  kinds: none
- entrance detection follows listed rules: The entrances the reading detects come only from the rules its language lists (CANDIDATE_RULES: for TypeScript, server functions, wrapped exports, server routes, route handlers, request proxies, page routes, server actions, route tables, route methods, package bins, package scripts and top-level scripts; for Python, URL patterns, viewsets, route decorators, management commands, tasks, console scripts and scripts), each carrying its rule and why it matched, never from a test file, a path inside a string, an include(), a TanStack Start file route without server handlers or a script another file imports; a detected entrance records the declared handlers and guards its own statement calls, bound in its file, one level into the file's own helpers.
  over: every rule both languages list over a TypeScript and a Python project holding each shape and each near miss, and a wrapper a file neither imports nor declares
  via: entrance detection
  because: c-3760638e: the coverage of the declared entrances is only as honest as what they are measured against, so detection is a short list of shapes a framework or runner fixes, each explained where it is shown, and precision wins over recall; what the rules cannot see is said beside the counts. A wrapper's namesake counted as a registration would group entrances that are not registered through it. A URL pattern or a registration is read across lines: a per-line scan missed every path( call whose route sat on the next line, and three of billing's routes were declared by hand (df-8f004647)
  crossing: project-source -> reading
  refuted: counted a wrapper call as a registration without checking the file imports or declares it, in throughOf -> the totality oracle went red; restored, green (2026-09-28); matched a URL pattern only when its route sat on the line of path(, as the per-line scan did -> the Python rules test went red; restored, green (2026-10-06)
  kinds: none
- the request proxy is an entrance: The proxy a Next.js proxy.ts exports, or the middleware a middleware.ts exports, at the project root or under src/, is detected as a request proxy, whether declared, named in an export list or re-export, or the file's default export; a helper beside it, a namesake in another folder and a test file are not.
  over: a declared proxy with a helper and a config beside it, a middleware re-exported under an alias, a default-exported middleware, a proxy under lib/ and one in a test file
  via: the request proxy rule detects the proxy a Next.js proxy.ts exports, or the middleware a middleware.ts exports, at the root or under src/: declared, re-exported, or the default export
  because: Next.js 16 renamed middleware to proxy, and the proxy runs before every request it matches, yet a real adoption's detection missed it (df-6cdc0504)
  crossing: project-source -> reading
  refuted: narrowed the request proxy file pattern to proxy.ts alone, so middleware.ts was no proxy -> "the request proxy rule detects the proxy a Next.js proxy.ts exports, or the middleware a middleware.ts exports, at the root or under src/: declared, re-exported, or the default export" went red in src/adapters/entrance-candidates.test.ts; restored, green (2026-10-05)
  kinds: none
- a route file's export list names its methods: Every HTTP method a Next.js app/**/route file exports by name without declaring it is detected as a route handler: re-exported from another module, listed under an alias, or destructured; a non-method in the list and a destructuring in a file that is no route file are not.
  over: a NextAuth route re-exporting GET and POST, a multi-line export list of aliases with a non-method, a one-line destructuring of handlers, and the multi-line destructuring in the module that declares them
  via: a Next.js route file's methods are read from its export lists too: re-exported, listed under an alias, or destructured
  because: a NextAuth route file only re-exports the GET and POST its auth module destructures, so a real adoption detected neither (df-6cdc0504)
  crossing: project-source -> reading
  refuted: read export lists only in proxy files, never in a Next.js route file -> "a Next.js route file's methods are read from its export lists too: re-exported, listed under an alias, or destructured" went red in src/adapters/entrance-candidates.test.ts; restored, green (2026-10-05)
  kinds: none
- a page route is an entrance: The default export of a Next.js app/**/page file is detected as a page route, the file as a whole; a layout, a page under app/routes and a page file with no default export are not.
  over: a page in a (group) folder, a page under a [slug] segment, a layout, a page.tsx under app/routes and a page file exporting only a config
  via: the page route rule detects the default export of a Next.js app/**/page file as the page as a whole, and no layout, app/routes file or page without a default export
  because: a page renders on the server for every visitor and is where a chat app's work enters from the browser, yet page routes were listed as not detected and a real adoption declared its chat page by hand (df-6cdc0504)
  crossing: project-source -> reading
  refuted: never looked for a page file's default export, so no page route was detected -> "the page route rule detects the default export of a Next.js app/**/page file as the page as a whole, and no layout, app/routes file or page without a default export" went red in src/adapters/entrance-candidates.test.ts; restored, green (2026-10-05)
  kinds: none
- a listing answers as git does: keepProjectFiles and projectSites given a listing taken once keep exactly the paths they keep asking git: tracked, untracked and unignored, a tracked file just deleted, and never an ignored, nested, folder or outside path.
  over: tracked, untracked, ignored, deleted, nested, folder, outside and absolute paths in one repository
  via: keepProjectFiles with a listing taken once answers exactly as it does asking git: tracked, untracked, ignored, deleted, nested, folder and outside paths
  because: a git listing per question cost three git processes per declaration a reading asks about, about 85 percent of reading Coherence's own tree (129 s to 11 s once removed, the reading byte for byte the same); the listing is only worth taking if it can never keep a file git would not, or drop one it would
  refuted: made keepProjectFiles keep every candidate when given a listing -> "keepProjectFiles with a listing taken once answers exactly as it does asking git: tracked, untracked, ignored, deleted, nested, folder and outside paths" went red in listing.test.ts on its own assertion; restored byte for byte, green batched and alone (2026-10-06)
  kinds: none
- the adapter's listing lasts until forget: The TypeScript adapter takes the project's files and git's listing once per forget, so a name resolved in a file and a reference site kept ask no git between forgets, and a file created after the listing is found after the next forget.
  over: a file present at the first question, and a file created after it, before and after a forget
  via: the TypeScript adapter reads the project's files once per forget: a file created after the listing is found only after a forget
  because: the warm instrument answers many questions between edits, and every path that changes the tree (a run, the check at an edit, a live reading's refresh) calls forget first, so a listing kept past a forget would hide a new file from the chokepoint check, and one taken per question costs a git process each time
  refuted: kept the walked file list across a forget -> "the TypeScript adapter reads the project's files once per forget: a file created after the listing is found only after a forget" went red in listing.test.ts on its own assertion; restored byte for byte, green batched and alone (2026-10-06)
  kinds: none
- the Python adapter's listing lasts until forget: The Python adapter takes the project's files and git's listing once per forget, so a name resolved in a module, a star import scanned, and a reference site kept ask no git between forgets, and a module created after the listing is found after the next forget.
  over: a module present at the first question, and a module created after it, before and after a forget
  via: the Python adapter reads the project's files once per forget: a module created after the listing is found only after a forget
  because: the same per-question git cost the TypeScript adapter carried (d-55040f81) sat in the Python adapter's resolve and reference filter, which is what reads a Python adopter such as PostHog; a listing kept past a forget would hide a new module from the chokepoint check
  refuted: kept the Python adapter's walked file list across a forget -> "the Python adapter reads the project's files once per forget: a module created after the listing is found only after a forget" went red in listing.test.ts on its own assertion; restored byte for byte, green batched and alone (2026-10-06)
  kinds: none
- a cold server resolves what the project declares: The TypeScript adapter loads the project through a source file inside a component folder, and a name the server does not know yet is looked for in the files whose text spells it and confirmed by their document symbols, so a fresh server never answers no symbol for a name the project declares.
  over: a project whose first source file lies outside the tsconfig, on a fresh server, at the first question
  via: a cold server resolves a name the project declares even when the first source file of the walk lies outside the TypeScript project
  because: a bench script outside the tsconfig became the first source file the walk met, so a fresh server loaded only an inferred project around it and answered no symbol for every bare name; the check at an edit then recorded not run and printed nothing, which let a bypass of run appended never rewritten reach main unseen
  refuted: chose the first source file of the walk as the seed again, inside a component or not -> "a cold server resolves a name the project declares even when the first source file of the walk lies outside the TypeScript project" went red in listing.test.ts on its own assertion; restored byte for byte, green batched and alone (2026-10-06)
  kinds: none
- the adapter's git spawns do not grow with the names asked: Between forgets, the TypeScript adapter spawns git a fixed number of times however many names are resolved and asked for their references.
  over: a project of two declarations and one of eight, every name resolved and asked for its references after one forget
  via: the TypeScript adapter spawns git a fixed number of times between forgets, whatever the number of names asked
  because: one git listing per references question made the Structure reading and npm test about five times slower for two weeks (d-55040f81) before anyone looked; a count of spawns is the same under any load, so the shape that cost the time alarms the day it returns, where a timing would flake
  refuted: took git's listing afresh at every references question instead of once per forget -> "the TypeScript adapter spawns git a fixed number of times between forgets, whatever the number of names asked" went red in listing.test.ts on its own assertion (4 spawns against 10); restored byte for byte, green batched and alone (2026-10-07)
  kinds: budget
  checklist: bounded-admission dismissed: nothing is admitted; the bound is a count of child processes per forget
  checklist: execution-budget declared as the adapter's git spawns do not grow with the names asked
  checklist: memory-budget dismissed: the bound is on spawned processes, not on allocation
  checklist: circuit-breaker-policy dismissed: no dependency failures are observed
  checklist: fair-admission dismissed: there are no contenders for the budget
  checklist: rate-budget dismissed: nothing is counted against a time window
- a nested Python project resolves imports from the repository top: The Python adapter for a project nested below its repository's top adds the top to Pyright's import search, never to its workspace, so a reference in the project written through an import from the top resolves and is classified like any other.
  over: a bypass in a nested Python project reached through an import written from the repository top
  via: a nested Python project's imports written from the repository top resolve, so a bypass inside the project through one is found
  because: PostHog's code imports its own modules from the repository top (products.notebooks.backend.query_validation); Pyright started on the nested folder could not resolve them, so a bypass inside the project went unreported and the chokepoint graded reference-choked (df-0d235229)
  refuted: the Python adapter left the repository top out of Pyright's import search -> "a nested Python project's imports written from the repository top resolve, so a bypass inside the project through one is found" went red in monorepo.test.ts on its own assertion; restored byte for byte, green batched and alone (2026-10-07)
  kinds: none
- a registry leaf inherits key by key: A project a repository's registry lists reads the registry's config keys under its own: its own file overrides a key at a time, ignore and wellKnown concatenate, the test keys are inherited or replaced as one group, name, entryDir, lexicon and projects are never inherited, and a relative path an inherited key holds resolves against the file that declared it, so a registry test setup's cwd "." is the repository top and a registry ignore path inside the leaf is rebased to it.
  over: a leaf with its own config overriding latencyBudget, wellKnown and the test group, and a leaf with none, under a registry declaring language, ignore names and paths, wellKnown, latencyBudget, references and a test setup with a cwd
  via: a registry leaf inherits the registry's keys, its own config overriding key by key, and inherited paths resolve against the file that declared them
  because: a monorepo opting in many leaves states its test runner, ignore list and budgets once; a leaf that read only its own file would run its tests from the wrong folder or not at all, and an inherited relative path read against the leaf would name a folder that does not exist
  refuted: effectiveConfig inherited the registry's test setups without rebasing their cwd to the leaf -> "a registry leaf inherits the registry's keys, its own config overriding key by key, and inherited paths resolve against the file that declared them" went red in registry.test.ts on its own assertion; restored byte for byte, green batched and alone (2026-10-07)
  kinds: none
- Python stages a use from outside an exempted folder: Under a from: line that exempts a folder, the Python adapter's refutation stages an unsaved use of the protected thing from outside that folder, and the check classes the package's own references exempt and another package's a bypass.
  over: a Python package whose own module references its protected internal, a facade module chokepoint, and a reference from a sibling package, under from anywhere and outside the component
  via: Python: a chokepoint from outside the component exempts its own references and still catches a bypass from another component; from anywhere calls both bypasses
  because: the exemption is classified in the check, but what the refutation can stage is the adapter's: a use beside the protected thing lies inside the exempted folder, so without a document outside it the refutation would prove only that a re-export is caught, never that the exemption stops at the folder
  crossing: instrument -> reading
  refuted: stopped the Python adapter expecting its staged use from outside the exempted folder -> "Python: a chokepoint from outside the component exempts its own references and still catches a bypass from another component; from anywhere calls both bypasses" went red in python-from.test.ts on its own assertion; restored byte for byte, green batched and alone (2026-10-07)
  kinds: none
- tach configuration read as tach reads it: The nearest tach.toml at or above the project root governs a Python chokepoint only when one tach module holds both the protected thing and the chokepoint, and an interface from that module without a visibility list exposes the chokepoint while no interface exposes the protected thing or a package above it; from and expose match as whole regular expressions, and a module carrying the deprecated strict alone is not governed.
  over: every tach.toml at or above the root and every combination of from pattern, expose pattern, interface visibility, strict, nested modules and the module's own path
  via: tach reads tach.toml as tach 0.34 does: the nearest file at or above the root, regex from and expose matched whole, a visibility list constraining only its modules, an exposed package above the internal
  because: the rung credits tach with a refusal, so it must stand exactly where tach refuses; read from tach 0.35 itself, "store" in expose covers an import of the module store but not of a name in it, an interface with a visibility list leaves every unlisted module free, and an exposed package above the internal lets any module reach the internal as an attribute
  crossing: project-source -> reading
  refuted: matched tach patterns as prefixes instead of whole, in fullMatch -> "tach reads tach.toml as tach 0.34 does: the nearest file at or above the root, regex from and expose matched whole, a visibility list constraining only its modules, an exposed package above the internal" went red in src/adapters/tach.test.ts on its own assertion; restored byte for byte, green batched and alone (2026-10-07)
  kinds: none
- tach draws the module boundary: Where tach governs, the chokepoint grades checker-choked with tach (tach.toml) as the enforcer and the interface as the fact, a reference in the module's own code is inside, and every import tach refused that reaches the protected thing is a bypass carrying tach's error; without a tach.toml the grading is Coherence's own.
  over: every Python chokepoint whose protected thing lies in a module a tach.toml declares, a clean tree, a tree with an outside import planted, and the same tree without tach.toml
  via: a chokepoint tach governs grades checker-choked by tach with the interface as the fact, the module's own use inside; a planted outside import grades broken with tach's interface error as the bypass; without tach.toml the grading is Coherence's own
  because: PostHog declares 101 tach modules and 42 interfaces and runs tach check --dependencies --interfaces in CI, so tach, not Coherence's reading of Pyright's references, is what refuses an import of a product's internals; tach lets a module use its own internals, and re-deriving the boundary from references called every such use a bypass of the facade
  crossing: instrument -> reading
  refuted: classified a reference in the tach module's own code by Coherence's rule alone, ignoring the boundary, in checkChokepoint -> "a chokepoint tach governs grades checker-choked by tach with the interface as the fact, the module's own use inside; a planted outside import grades broken with tach's interface error as the bypass; without tach.toml the grading is Coherence's own" went red in src/adapters/tach.test.ts on its own assertion; restored byte for byte, green batched and alone (2026-10-07)

- tach's refusal is the refutation: The refutation of a chokepoint tach governs stages an import of the protected thing in another tach module of a throwaway copy of the tree, runs tach over it, and records refused by the checker only when tach refuses that import; the copy is removed and nothing is written into the project.
  over: every chokepoint tach governs, its staged outside import, and the project tree and temporary folder after the refutation
  via: tach's refusal of an outside import staged in a throwaway copy is the refutation, and the copy is gone with nothing written into the project
  because: a module's own code is free to use its internals, so a synthetic site staged beside the protected thing proves nothing where tach governs; only tach refusing an outside import shows the rung's enforcer would fire, and tach reads files from disk, so the import is staged in a copy whose other entries link to the project's, which tach does not walk
  crossing: instrument -> record
  refuted: read tach's refusal back from the line after the staged import, in witnessTach -> "tach's refusal of an outside import staged in a throwaway copy is the refutation, and the copy is gone with nothing written into the project" went red in src/adapters/tach.test.ts with the refutation missing; restored byte for byte, green batched and alone (2026-10-07)
  kinds: none
- tach absent is a reason: A tach.toml that would govern a chokepoint with no tach installed, or with a tach that does not answer, earns no tach rung, and the grade's reason says where tach was looked for.
  over: a governed chokepoint with tach missing, with COHERENCE_TACH naming a binary that does not exist
  via: without tach installed the tach rung is not available and the grade says why
  because: tach is the adopter's dependency, not Coherence's; a rung granted without the checker on the machine would credit a refusal nobody can make, and a silent fallback would hide why the grade dropped
  crossing: instrument -> reading
  refuted: fell back silently when tach is not installed, dropping the note, in tachVerdict -> "without tach installed the tach rung is not available and the grade says why" went red in src/adapters/tach.test.ts on its own assertion; restored byte for byte, green batched and alone (2026-10-07)
  kinds: none
- tach at an edit spawns only for a tach module's file: At an edit, tach runs only over the Python files the edit wrote that lie in a tach module, in a throwaway copy, and an edit that wrote none spawns no tach.
  over: an edit to a file in no tach module, an edit to a file inside one, a clean and a leaking edit, and a repeat edit outside after the refusal was witnessed
  via: an edit spawns tach only when a file it wrote is a Python file inside a tach module, and checks only those files
  because: the tool hooks hold a 3 s latency budget, and tach over the whole of PostHog takes about two seconds where over one edited file in a throwaway copy it takes about 190 ms; a count of spawns is the same under any load, so a hook that starts running tach for a file tach cannot judge alarms the day it does
  crossing: instrument -> reading
  refuted: ran tach over the whole tree at an edit too, in tachRun -> "an edit spawns tach only when a file it wrote is a Python file inside a tach module, and checks only those files" went red in src/adapters/tach.test.ts on its own assertion (tach spawned for an edit outside every tach module); restored byte for byte, green batched and alone (2026-10-07)
  kinds: budget
  checklist: bounded-admission dismissed: nothing is admitted; the bound is a count of child processes per edit
  checklist: execution-budget declared as tach at an edit spawns only for a tach module's file
  checklist: memory-budget dismissed: the bound is on spawned processes, not on allocation
  checklist: circuit-breaker-policy dismissed: no dependency failures are observed
  checklist: fair-admission dismissed: there are no contenders for the budget
  checklist: rate-budget dismissed: nothing is counted against a time window
