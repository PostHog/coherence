 * their prior dated verdict in the status view.
 *
 * The totality pass runs the project's whole test suite before the first
 * question the instrument is asked, and the warm server's idle timer only
 * resets on a request line: a suite longer than the idle timeout used to kill
 * the instrument mid-run, record not run for every chokepoint, and exit 0. The
 * run now keeps the instrument alive across the test pass with a heartbeat and
 * asks it again afterwards; a run whose instrument died says so in every entry
 * and in `instrumentDied`, and the command exits non-zero.
