/**
 * The chokepoint check: for one chokepoint-form enforcement, resolve the
 * protected thing and the chokepoint, collect every reference to the
 * protected thing and the chokepoint, and classify each site.
 *
 * Two sites carry a form the language gives them, and the form is read
 * before the range (ruling d-7abd1ba8):
 *
 *   inside   a plain import specifier sitting in the chokepoint's own module
 *            — the one location through which the chokepoint reaches the
 *            thing — or any site within the chokepoint symbol's range, or
 *            within its module when the chokepoint is a module; for a
 *            protected module, within the module itself
 *   reference an adapter-reported reference to the chokepoint outside its own
 *             definition; it may be an import, re-export, type use, or call,
 *             and makes no stronger semantic claim
 *   test      under a test folder or a test file by name; retained separately
 *             on every site and used as the protected-site class
 *   bypass   an export-from specifier or a wildcard re-export of the protected thing, wherever it
 *            stands, because it widens the thing's reach with no call at
 *            all; an import of the protected thing in any other module; and
 *            every other site outside the chokepoint
 *
 * The grade follows: visibility-choked when the protected thing is not
 * visible outside its module and nothing bypasses (the adapter says whether
 * its language can reach this rung); reference-choked when visible and
 * nothing bypasses; broken when a bypass exists or the chokepoint cannot be
 * resolved; not chokeable when the protected thing cannot be resolved as a
 * symbol or a module.
 *
 * The refutation must prove that this check would fire, and who enforces the
 * graded rung decides how. Where Coherence's check is the enforcer, the
 * adapter stages the synthetic sites the form rule could otherwise swallow —
 * a use in the chokepoint's own module past its range, and a re-export — and
 * the check classifies each with the same function every other site goes
 * through; only when it calls every one `bypass` does the refutation fire. A
 * staged site the instrument could not see, or one the check would call
 * `inside` (the chokepoint covers everywhere the language lets the thing be
 * named) or `test` (the protected thing lives under a test folder, so nothing
 * can ever be a bypass), proves only that the instrument answers, and the
 * check says which and records not run. Where the language is the enforcer
 * (visibility-choked, closure-choked), Coherence's check can never be made to
 * fire, and the compiler's or interpreter's refusal of the synthetic outside
 * reference is the refutation instead (ruling rs-e93ecdd6).
