/**
 * The latest chokepoint verdict's files, indexed so an edit never parses the
 * run history. The run store is append-only: one JSONL file per session
 * under .coherence/runs. The index is one small file,
 * .coherence/cache/run-index.json: for each run file, the identity it was
 * read at (device, inode, size, modification and change time) and the byte
 * offset read to; for each chokepoint enforcement, its latest run's files.
 *
 * It is an optimization of a check, so it fails toward the slow, correct
 * path and says so, never toward silence:
 *
 * - every read verifies it: each run file is stat'd, and an index that does
 *   not name exactly the run files there are, at the identities they have, is
 *   rebuilt from every run file before it answers;
 * - it is written whole, aside, and renamed into place, so a crash leaves the
 *   old index or the new one, never half of one, and a stale one is caught
 *   by the verification;
 * - an append folds its own line in only when the index held the file just
 *   before it; a fold that cannot be made (a lock not had, a cache that cannot
 *   be written) leaves the index stale, which the next read catches;
 * - when the index cannot be rebuilt and written, a lookup throws
 *   RunIndexUnavailable, and its caller reads the whole store and says why.
 *
 * Latest means what latestByEnforcement means: the last record in the order
 * loadRuns sorts them, by time, then by file and line.
