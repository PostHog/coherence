/**
 * The test suite's leak guard: loaded into every test file's process with
 * `--import`, it fails the file when the file leaves a process or a temp
 * folder behind, and names each one.
 *
 * Each test file gets a folder of its own under the system temp folder,
 * and TMPDIR points at it for the file and everything it spawns. So every
 * `mkdtemp(join(tmpdir(), ...))` a test, a fixture, or the code under test
 * makes lands inside it, and every process the file starts, detached or
 * not, carries that folder in its environment. When the file's process
 * exits, after its tests and their `after` hooks, the guard looks for:
 * - an entry still in the file's temp folder;
 * - a process, other than this one, that descends from it, or whose command
 *   line or environment names the file's temp folder.
 *
 * A detached warm server a CLI-level test started outlived the test and
 * raced its cleanup, with every test green; this makes that class red. What
 * leaked is killed and removed after it is named, so a failing file still
 * leaves nothing behind. The file's folder is gone either way.
 *
 * The same process keeps the unit suite's cost budgets (test-budgets.ts):
 * every spawn passes the work meter's watch, so a file that launches
 * Coherence's own command line more than its spawn budget, or reads
 * Coherence's own tree, fails at exit with each launch or read named by the
 * test that made it; and every test is timed between hooks on the file's
 * root, and fails past its ceiling.
 *
 * It also starts the parser runtime, as the CLI does before any command, so
 * a test that asks a reading of a language read through a parser finds it
 * started (syntax-trees.ts).
 *
 * It points XDG_CONFIG_HOME at a folder of the file's own, removed with it,
 * so no test writes into the developer's Coherence folder.
 *
 * Inert in the runner's parent process (no NODE_TEST_CONTEXT), and in any
 * process a test spawns that does not itself load this module.
