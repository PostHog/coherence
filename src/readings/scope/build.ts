/**
 * The Scope reading's two halves: the state, and the fixed shell that shows it.
 *
 * The state: Coherence's lexicon (and the project's domain lexicon of the
 * same shape, when it has one), the spec model, the run records, the journal
 * records and the work orders, loaded into the model once by scopeState, the
 * one function every reader of the state goes through (the snapshot here,
 * the warm server's live reading in live.ts, the agent query).
 *
 * The shell: the styles, the embedded font and the browser script joined into
 * one HTML document whose bytes depend on no project content. Live, the warm
 * server serves it and the page fetches its state and follows the stores as
 * they grow (live.ts). A snapshot is the same shell with one inline state, a
 * self-contained file for sharing and CI (snapshotOf). The browser renders
 * either with the same pure render.
 *
 * With --root the state is read over another project: its spec tree, its
 * .coherence/runs, .coherence/journal and .coherence/work, and its lexicon
 * (named in coherence.config.json under `lexicon`, else lexicon.json at
 * its root) as the domain layer beneath Coherence's own. The command line is
 * cli.ts.
