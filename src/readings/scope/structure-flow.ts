/**
 * The Structure map: what a system is made of and how work flows through
 * it, derived from the state on every render and stored nowhere. It is drawn
 * the way transit maps and process drawings are: journeys, not connections.
 *
 * Nodes are the components visible at the current zoom: one level of the
 * component tree at a time, a component opened in place showing its children
 * beside its own code. Edges are component interfaces, from caller to
 * callee: for each ordered pair of visible components, the symbols the
 * caller's non-test code references in the callee, as the language adapter
 * resolved them (the state's `componentInterfaces` reading, aggregated up to
 * the visible components). Without that reading only the references the
 * latest runs recorded (to chokepoints and protected things) are known, and
 * the model says so. Every component interface is in the model; none is
 * implied away.
 *
 * Structural routes. Each entrance's route is the path its handler takes
 * (ROUTE_RULE): the component that declares it, the component holding its
 * handler, then, with the handler's static reach read, from each stop the
 * heaviest component interface that reach uses through a symbol only that
 * stop's component calls (never a type, never a utility another component
 * also calls), never into a core dependency and never to a column left of
 * the last: it stops where the reach goes no further. Without a reach, the
 * heaviest interface onward, which is reference weight, not flow, and says
 * so. Entrances share one line only when they share its stops and its trust
 * (the trust level each declares it carries in, else, derived, the entering
 * side of the crossings whose chokepoint is its handler: d-ba18b0fd), and
 * what they declare of their control, a guard: line or control: none
 * (d-a1095ef2); the line is named for them, at most four names on its
 * token. An entrance that declares control: none, with its reason, is never
 * marked no traced control: its route says no control needed. A project
 * that declares no entrance has its routes derived from the root
 * component's component interfaces, one per callee, each named "via" the
 * first component it reaches and marked reference weight.
 *
 * Core dependencies. A component that more than half of the other visible
 * components call, with at least three callers and at least three quarters
 * of its component interfaces incoming, is a utility: drawn as a rail its
 * callers attach to by a stub, never as a route stop or an arrow.
 *
 * Interface identifiers. Every chokepoint gets a short identifier from its
 * place in the chokepoint list (C for a chokepoint, X for one whose
 * invariant carries a crossing), drawn on each component interface it
 * stands on, and once on a rail for the stubs into a core dependency.
 *
 * An interface is annotated from the invariants, never authored: the
 * chokepoint that stands on it (a chokepoint symbol among its symbols), the
 * crossing of that invariant when trust changes there, and the classes of
 * data that pass (the trust levels of those crossings). A bypass the latest
 * run classified on the pair marks it broken.
 *
 * Placement. A component's column is its true distance from where work
 * enters, uncapped: the fewest component interfaces from a component that
 * declares an entrance (the root when none does), never through a core
 * dependency; what no entrance reaches is measured from a component nothing
 * but a core dependency calls, which stands where work enters, undeclared. Within a column
 * components keep folder order, and each sits in the row that keeps the
 * routes reaching it from the column before as straight as that order
 * allows. Stability is stable relative order: adding one component
 * interface moves out of its column only what the interface reaches (its
 * callee and what the callee reaches, or everything its caller reaches when
 * the interface stops the caller being a core dependency), and never
 * reorders, within a column, components that keep their columns.
 * Everything is a pure function of entrances and component interfaces, ties
 * broken by name; no position is stored.
 *
 * The comparison seam: `compareFlows` takes two models (two states, two
 * commits) and names what changed with the five measures Structure's diff
 * will show.
