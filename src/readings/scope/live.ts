/**
 * The live Scope reading, as the warm server answers it over HTTP.
 *
 * The server's guard (admitHttp in the warm server) has already checked the
 * Host, the method, the origin and the token before a request reaches here;
 * this file answers only GET and HEAD, and only these paths:
 *
 *   /                the fixed shell: its bytes depend on no project content
 *   /api/state       the first load: the windowed state, its version, and where history starts
 *   /api/events      the event stream: catch-up from the page's cursors, then every update
 *   /api/journal     older journal records by cursor (before=<at>~<id>), or matching a search (q=)
 *   /api/runs        older run records by cursor (before=<at>~<session>)
 *   /api/record      one journal record by id, for a citation the page has not loaded
 *   /api/sites       every reference site of one chokepoint entry (run=<at>~<session>, component, name), where the first load counted some
 *
 * The state is loaded once through scopeState, whole, and kept current: the
 * journal, runs and work folders are watched, and an append is read back
 * from its store and sent as the records that are new (by id, or a run's time
 * and session); a spec, a practice file, a lexicon or the config changing
 * (whatever the spec model reads by name) reloads the state and sends it as
 * a snapshot with a new version. The component interfaces
 * are read through the server's own instrument (or, for a Python adoption
 * the config bounds, a bounded server the reading keeps for itself) when the
 * reading is first asked for and again when a run lands, never on every file
 * save, within the same budget as a snapshot's.
 *
 * The vocabulary coverage is read on a worker thread (coverage-reading.ts),
 * when the reading is first asked for and again when the model reloads: a
 * full reading scans the whole corpus, and this loop also answers the
 * agent's hooks. The first load and a reloaded snapshot never wait for it;
 * they carry the coverage as being read, and the reading follows as an
 * update.
 *
 * A page resumes from cursors derived from what it holds. The catch-up sends
 * every record at or after a little before each cursor, since a writer whose
 * clock read earlier can append after a later record; the page merges by
 * key, so the overlap is held once and nothing is lost.
 *
 * Node-only; the browser bundle never imports it.
