 * every key the file said, so nothing is lost between the file and the page.
 *
 * A concept is split three ways. Its vocabulary is what a definition needs:
 * name, definition, status, aliases, rejected alternatives with their because,
 * distinctions, properties, related names, open questions. Its detail is
 * definitional sub-structure. Its provenance is history: who defined it, the
 * owner's words, the metaphor, the evidence. The page shows vocabulary on the
 * card and keeps detail and provenance one click away, each under its own
 * name, so history is never mistaken for definition.
 *
 * State is a concrete value of this shape. The page holds exactly one
 * `ShellState` and derives everything it shows from it.
