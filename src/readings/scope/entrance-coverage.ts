/**
 * Entrance coverage (c-3760638e): how much of the surface the reading
 * detected the declared entrances cover, so a spec-gap count can be read
 * against it. A project that declares 14 coarse entrances and one that
 * declares 94 fine ones over the same code have gap counts that cannot be
 * compared; their coverage can.
 *
 * A detected entrance is covered when a declared entrance
 *   names it     the handler is its symbol, in its file (a symbol registered
 *                in a route table or a URL pattern is matched by name, since
 *                it is declared elsewhere); a file-grain one (a script, a
 *                package bin) is named by any handler in that file
 *   or, when the handler names no detected entrance, stands for it:
 *     through    its own statement calls the handler (every server function
 *                wrapped in mutationRpc, for "server function mutations",
 *                handled by mutationRpc)
 *     module     it is detected in the handler's own file (a registry: a
 *                urls.py whose urlpatterns is the handler)
 * It is covered individually when some entrance covering it covers nothing
 * else, and by a grouped entrance otherwise. Pure, and browser-safe: the view,
 * the query and orient read the same derivation.
