/**
 * Undeclared entrances at hook time: the detected entrances no declared
 * entrance covers (entrance-coverage.ts, c-3760638e), as orient and regulate
 * name them, and what `scaffold entrances` proposes for them.
 *
 * Detection is a plain scan of the tree that asks the language server
 * nothing, so unlike the spec gaps it needs no recorded Structure reading:
 * orient and regulate detect now, against the spec as it stands, and a
 * session that just declared an entrance sees it counted at once.
 *
 * No adoption baseline (the gap baseline's convention is not reused): the
 * line is one bounded line whatever the count, naming a folder rather than a
 * list, so there is nothing to silence; and in the replicated A/B adoption
 * test coverage stayed at 11 to 14 percent in both arms, so a baseline taken
 * on day one would hide exactly the surface that was never declared.
 *
 * Node-only; the browser bundle never imports it.
