/**
 * The kept answers: what the language server said to each question a
 * component interface reading asked it (a name resolved to its definition,
 * a definition's reference sites), kept under .coherence/structure beside
 * the recorded reading, so the next reading asks the server only what the
 * tree's changes could have changed.
 *
 * An answer depends on source text and nothing a spec says: which
 * declarations are asked, which component a site belongs to, every
 * entrance's handler, reach, guards and chokepoints are worked out by the
 * reading over the answers, from the specs as they stand. So a spec edit
 * (an entrance declared, a guard: line, a chokepoint) leaves every answer
 * standing, and the reading that follows asks the server only for a
 * question no earlier reading asked, such as a new handler's name.
 *
 * Each language's answers are kept with the content hash of every project
 * file in that language's extensions, as the reading that asked them
 * started. A later reading compares the tree with those hashes, and every
 * file that changed, appeared or went (the changed files) drops each answer
 * that could depend on it: one whose definition, candidates or reference
 * sites sit in a changed file; one whose name (or an alias it is given) a
 * changed file now spells, since a server reports a declaration or a
 * reference only where the text names it; one a changed file star-imports
 * or wildcard re-exports, where no name is spelled; and a default export,
 * imported under any name, on any change at all. What survives is reused
 * without starting the server; what was dropped is asked again. One source
 * edit rereads only what that file touches.
 *
 * What the server's answers rest on beyond the project's source (the
 * project's language configuration, manifests and lockfiles, the config's
 * bounds and test folders, and the adapter's own code and Coherence's
 * version) is the answers' basis: when it differs, nothing kept is used and
 * the reading says why it asks everything again. Kept answers are never
 * used silently: the reading carries how many it reused and asked, and how
 * many files had changed.
 *
 * Node-only; the browser bundle never imports it.
