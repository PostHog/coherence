/**
 * How the live page folds what the warm server sends into its one state.
 *
 * The server sends a first load (a windowed state), then updates on an event
 * stream: journal, runs and work appends as the records that are new, a
 * recomputed snapshot when a spec, a glossary or the config changes, and the
 * component interfaces when the language server has read them again. Every
 * update is merged into the state the page already holds and the page
 * renders again; nothing is kept beside the state.
 *
 * Merging is idempotent: records are keyed (a journal record and a work
 * record by id, a run by its time and session), so a record sent twice is
 * held once, and a catch-up that overlaps what the page holds adds nothing.
 * The cursors a page resumes from are derived from the state, never stored:
 * the latest journal record, the latest run, the latest work record.
 *
 * Shared by the browser bundle and the Node tests; it imports types only.
