/**
 * The Structure map's render, drawn the way transit maps and process
 * drawings are. Each structural route is one line of its own color from its
 * named origin (the names of the entrances it starts from, in full, stacked
 * one per line in the left margin, or "via" the first component it reaches,
 * marked derived) through its stations in order, left to right, never back
 * to a column it has left; routes that pass the same component meet at its
 * station and run side by side at fixed offsets, never merged. Every segment
 * is horizontal, vertical, or at 45 degrees. A route that stays in a column
 * drops straight down (or up) to the next station when it is the neighbour,
 * else turns in the column's lane. A core dependency is a rail along the
 * foot, labelled once, with the interface identifiers of its stubs drawn
 * once on it; each caller's stub runs to the rail and meets it, joining the
 * column's other stubs to that rail on one shared drop. A chokepoint or a
 * crossing is an interface identifier drawn on the pipe where it stands, one
 * button each, a crossing with a dashed trust boundary through it; its
 * meaning is in the inspector. A component interface on no route is drawn
 * faint, and only when a selection reaches it, unless an identifier stands
 * on it.
 *
 * At rest nothing is selected and every route is drawn: the whole system in
 * view, unless something is broken, when the broken component opens
 * selected. Red means broken and nothing else; the selection is a neutral
 * halo and weight, a color no route wears; attention that is not breakage
 * (nothing enforced, no control, not covered) is amber.
 *
 * Motion (the owner's rule): only the direction of work moves, and only on
 * what is selected. A selected route carries a slow, faint procession of
 * dashes from its entrance to its end, caller to callee, at one constant
 * speed, for as long as the selection holds; a selected component's lines
 * flow into it from its callers and out of it to its callees, one hop after
 * it lights; an identifier ticks each time a dash passes it. Clearing the
 * selection stops everything; broken marks never move. With reduced motion nothing animates and
 * small chevrons along the selected lines point caller to callee instead.
 *
 * Every piece of text has a priority and is placed only where it overlaps no
 * text and no station: station names first, then the named origins and rail
 * labels, the caption, identifiers, defect marks, and column captions. Lower
 * priority text is dropped, never overlapped, never truncated. Every
 * coordinate is computed here from the model on each render; no position is
 * stored or read.
