/**
 * Which of a project's languages a reading read: the one field every
 * reading carries in its result, and the one line every renderer prints.
 *
 * A project may declare several languages (the config's `language` list, the
 * first being the primary). A reading that covers fewer than the project
 * declares must say so, by name, in its output and in its JSON: a checking
 * tool that skips a language quietly reports a clean result it never read.
 * So the reading states what it read, and a language it did not read carries
 * the reason, and the renderers print the line whenever the project declares
 * more than one language. For one language the line is absent, so a
 * single-language reading prints exactly what it always did.
 *
 * primaryOnly is the one way a reading takes the primary language alone: it
 * hands back the language together with the statement that the others were
 * not read, so the statement cannot be left behind. A test (languages-read.test.ts)
 * refuses any reading that takes the config's primary language another way.
