/**
 * The reading of every component interface: the set of resolved references
 * from one component to another, taken through the language adapter.
 *
 * The reading is bounded to the declared components. The code it reads is
 * the component code: every non-test source file the config's bounds keep
 * (its ignore list, and the folders no walk enters) whose nearest spec
 * folder is a component, each file belonging to that nearest component only,
 * so the root component holds the bounded files no deeper component claims
 * and never the whole tree below it. Only a declaration in component code is
 * ever asked about. A reference site counts toward an interface when it
 * sits in component code of another component. A site inside the bounds in
 * code no component owns is outside: counted per callee component and said,
 * never drawn and never silently dropped. Code past the config's bounds is
 * not the project's by the adopter's own word, so a site there is never
 * counted, and the server the reading starts for itself (a Python one) is
 * bounded the same way, which is what makes a monorepo readable: a
 * references query scans every workspace file that spells the name, and on
 * a whole monorepo one common name costs gigabytes.
 *
 * Before the server is asked, one word index is built over the component
 * code, once per reading: every identifier token of every file, with the
 * components whose files spell it. An exported declaration is asked for its
 * references only when a file of another component spells its name, or a
 * name it is aliased to, or a whole-module import or re-export there names
 * its file, or it is a default export. That is sound, not a heuristic: the
 * server reports a reference only where the text names the thing, so a name
 * no other component's text spells cannot have a site there. The escape
 * hatches are handled, not assumed away: a star import (`from x import *`)
 * or a wildcard re-export (`export * from`) spells no name and the adapters
 * report a site at it for every declaration of the module, so every
 * declaration of a module another component star-imports is asked; an alias
 * (`import a as b`, `export { a as b }`) extends the name to its aliases,
 * wherever the alias is written, so a caller that spells only the alias is
 * still found; a default export is imported under any name, so it is always
 * asked; `__all__` lists and `getattr` strings are tokens like any other,
 * since the index reads strings and comments too. Aliases are read over the
 * component code, where every site that counts sits.
 *
 * Each entrance's handler is resolved the same way, with its static reach:
 * the declarations its code references and every one those reference,
 * through value references only, and the component interfaces that reach
 * uses. The reach needs a component's own references too, which the word
 * index cannot rule out, so it is read to a fixed point: a declaration is
 * asked for the reach when a file the reach has already entered spells it
 * (its name or an alias), since a reference enclosed by a reached
 * declaration sits in that declaration's file. A private declaration is
 * resolved only for the reach: it is referenced from its own file and is
 * never an interface. A handler named as a module file starts from the
 * module's top-level script: every declaration of the file, and every
 * reference its top-level statements make (an import is not a use).
 *
 * Each entrance's reach is then read for the chokepoints it passes
 * (d-127ab8e4): one whose protected thing the reach reaches, marked a wrapper
 * when the handler's own declaration references the chokepoint, and one its
 * guard: line declares, confirmed when a reference to the handler at its
 * registration spells the guard. The Structure map counts only verified ones.
 *
 * The reading is bounded in time and in the language server's memory. When
 * either budget is spent it stops asking, keeps what it read, and says it is
 * partial, which budget stopped it, and whose declarations were not all
 * read; a partial map is never presented as complete.
 *
 * The reading itself is not stored here: the builder passes it into the
 * page state, and every list is sorted, so one tree reads the same every
 * time. What is kept is each answer the language server gave (kept-answers.ts),
 * which depends on source text and never on a spec: a later reading reuses
 * every answer no changed file could have changed, starts the server only
 * for a question none answers, and works out every component interface,
 * handler, reach, guard and chokepoint again from the specs as they stand.
 * The adapter is started in this process and never writes into the tree it
 * reads, so a read-only project can be read.
 *
 * This is Node-only; the browser bundle never imports it.
