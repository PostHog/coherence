/**
 * The published package's build: `npm run build`. Node will not strip types
 * from a file under node_modules, so the package ships JavaScript compiled
 * from src into dist, at the same depth, so every path a module takes from
 * its own location (the lexicon and checklist seed in docs, the package.json)
 * resolves the same compiled as in a checkout. Beside the JavaScript go the
 * files modules read at run time: the data files, the stylesheet, the Scope
 * browser sources stripped by the same stripper a checkout runs when it
 * builds a page, and the one font file the page embeds with its license.
 * npm runs this as prepare, so an install from the git repository builds too.
