/**
 * Practices in the model: each practice file paired with its folder's spec,

 * (Enforcement.spec.md, Enforcement.practice.md). Every record or commit a
 * practice cites must exist. An invariant it names must be one its sister
 * spec, or the component it names, declares. And once a practice has been
 * enacted, the text every enactment carried out is the floor: a step or a
 * pitfall that has since left the practice is a problem until a decision,
 * recorded at or after the latest enactment that carried it out, cites an
 * enactment of the practice, names the practice, and says why. Adding a step or a pitfall is free;
 * a candidate (never enacted) may change freely.
