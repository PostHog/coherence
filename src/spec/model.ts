/**
 * The model: every spec under a root, read into components, trust levels,
 * and invariants with their lifecycle state.
 *
 * A component is any folder with a spec file; nesting follows the folders,
 * with folders that hold no spec transparent. The entry component (the
 * config's entryDir, else the root) declares the trust levels crossings
 * name. Cross-spec facts are checked here: crossings against trust levels,
 * declared-as names against the invariants that exist, names unique within
 * a component, an entrance's declared trust against the declared levels and
 * against the crossings on its handler. State is derived from what the
 * bullet carries and, when runs exist under .coherence/runs, from the latest
 * run that checked each enforcement; with no run every enforcement reports as
 * declared, unverified.
