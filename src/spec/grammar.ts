/**
 * The spec grammar: one file, parsed into an intent, trust levels, and
 * invariant bullets.
 *
 *   # Name
 *
 *   One-line intent.
 *   owners: <who owns it, comma separated>       optional; declared, never routed on
 *
 *   ## trust levels            (entry spec only)
 *   - owner-trusted: full kernel access
 *   - public (outside): what anyone on the network sends   outside the system's control
 *
 *   ## entrances               (any spec)
 *   - <name>: <one-line meaning: what work enters here from outside>
 *     handler: <symbol, symbol in file, or a module file>   a module file: its top-level script is the handler
 *     trust: <the trust level it carries in>              optional; else derived from crossings
 *     guard: <a chokepoint's symbol>                     optional; the chokepoint its handler is registered through
 *     control: none — <reason>                           optional; it needs no control, and why (never beside guard:)
 *
 *   ## invariants
 *   - <name>: <sentence>
 *     protects: <symbol or module>            chokepoint form, with
 *     chokepoint: <symbol>
 *     from: anywhere | outside the component | outside <folder>   optional; which references the chokepoint governs
 *     over: <the set the detector is total over>   totality oracle form, with
 *     via: <the test>
 *     because: <why it exists, what it protects against>
 *     crossing: <trust level> -> <trust level>
 *     refuted: <what was broken> -> <what was seen> (YYYY-MM-DD)   the human account of a refutation record
 *     kinds: <a, b> | none
 *     checklist: <shape> declared as <invariant> | <shape> dismissed: <reason>
 *
 * Every bullet is an invariant; there is no other kind of claim. A value
 * still written as <a placeholder> parses but counts as absent, so a
 * scaffolded bullet can be written first and filled second. The sections the
 * reference used are refused by name with their replacement; any other
 * section is refused as unknown. The parser reports problems and never
 * throws on content; cross-spec facts (trust levels, declared-as names,
 * duplicate names, an entrance's trust against the crossings on its
 * handler) are checked by the model.
