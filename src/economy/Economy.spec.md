# Economy

The context closure of a change, the read traces that record what sessions actually loaded, calibrate over the two with an automatic outcome label, and mass: total and unreached, unreached first.

## invariants
- reach by either enforcement: Unreached mass counts a file reached when an invariant's chokepoint or its totality oracle reaches it, and says plainly which totality oracles could not be asked.
  over: every file of every component, against every latest run entry of either form
  via: mass counts reach by chokepoint or totality oracle, and says plainly when a totality oracle's run record does not name the files its test touched
  because: the lexicon says unreached mass is code that no invariant's chokepoint, and no invariant's totality oracle, references, and counting only chokepoints called a file unreached that a totality oracle covers, which is the diagnostic lying about the load it is there to weigh. A totality oracle entry whose run record names no file cannot be counted either way, so it is named rather than silently counted as reaching nothing: 33 of this project's own bullets are in that state today
  crossing: record -> reading
  refuted: counted reach from the chokepoint entry alone, so a file the totality oracle's run record named stood unreached -> "mass counts reach by chokepoint or totality oracle, and says plainly when a totality oracle's run record does not name the files its test touched" went red in economy.test.ts, the covered file listed as unreached; restored, green (2026-09-18)
  kinds: none
- economy is deterministic: The closure of the same files over the same tree is the same closure: the same entries in path order, the same why lines in order, the same token estimate; nothing about it is stored.
  over: every closure predicted for a set of files over one tree
  via: economy: one hop out, one hop in, the spec of each component, and the invariants whose protected thing or chokepoint lives in the given files; deterministic
  because: a reader compares the prediction with what a session read; a closure that changed between two readings of one tree would make every comparison noise, and a stored closure would be a second truth that disagrees with the references it summarizes
  crossing: instrument -> reading
  refuted: removed the path sort from the closure's entries so they came out in insertion order -> "economy: one hop out, one hop in, the spec of each component, and the invariants whose protected thing or chokepoint lives in the given files; deterministic" went red in economy.test.ts on the entry order; restored, green (2026-09-17)
  kinds: none
- calibrate label never manual: A sample's outcome is derived from the journal and the runs written after its snapshot, through one function; no field of a trace or a command line sets it.
  protects: labelSnapshot
  chokepoint: sampleOf
  over: every read trace with a snapshot
  via: calibrate: the outcome label is automatic; a later defect record labels defect, a later passing run labels clean, nothing later is unknown, and a label written into the trace is ignored
  because: in the reference every sample stayed unknown because labeling was a command nobody ran; the loop that makes economy an instrument closes only when the label falls out of records that exist for their own reasons, and a label anyone could write by hand would be the first thing written wrong
  crossing: record -> reading
  refuted: made sampleOf read an outcome field written into the snapshot instead of deriving it -> "calibrate: the outcome label is automatic; a later defect record labels defect, a later passing run labels clean, nothing later is unknown, and a label written into the trace is ignored" went red in economy.test.ts (expected unknown, saw clean); restored, green (2026-09-17)
  kinds: none
- mass reports unreached first: The printed mass leads with the unreached numbers, for the project and for each component, before the totals; it is a reading, never a threshold, never a baseline, and never fails on growth.
  over: every mass report printed for a tree
  via: mass: a file in no component and a file in a component that no invariant reaches count as unreached; unreached prints first; deterministic
  because: growth is not the danger, weight with no definition is; an agent glancing at the top line must feel the wobbly load first, and a number that failed on growth would teach deletion where the way down is an invariant
  crossing: project-source -> reading
  refuted: printed the total line before the unreached line -> "mass: a file in no component and a file in a component that no invariant reaches count as unreached; unreached prints first; deterministic" went red in economy.test.ts on the first printed line; restored, green (2026-09-17)
  kinds: none
- mass names folders with no spec of their own: Mass names every folder, at any depth inside a component, that directly holds three or more of its code files and has no spec of its own, with its numbers and the component that holds it; a folder with its own spec is a component and is never named.
  over: every folder inside a component's folder, at any depth, that holds code files directly
  via: mass names each folder of three or more code files that a component above it holds only because the folder has no spec of its own
  because: an adoption declared a spec per top-level folder and stopped, and every reading counted the nested units (credit balances, an inbox, each Temporal feature) as covered by the component above them; nothing said the reading had folded them, so a human had to ask the agent to go deeper (df-9750aee2). Naming each folded folder with its weight makes the next spec to write a printed line
  crossing: project-source -> reading
  refuted: named only the folders directly under the component, as a top-level walk would -> "mass names each folder of three or more code files that a component above it holds only because the folder has no spec of its own" went red in economy.test.ts, src/app/queue/inbox unnamed; restored, green (2026-10-06)
  kinds: none
- working change is the project's change: The economy of the working change starts from exactly the project files git reports as changed, each with how git reported it: staged, unstaged, and untracked files not ignored against HEAD, and with --since everything from the merge base of the ref and HEAD; a deletion is reported and never given, a rename is its new path noting the old, and no ignored file or nested checkout ever counts.
  over: every path git reports for the working change of one tree, with and without --since
  via: working change: staged, unstaged, and untracked project files against HEAD, deletions reported and renames as the new path, never an ignored file or a nested checkout; --since adds everything from the merge base; sorted and deterministic
  because: an agent asking what its change must load should not have to list what it changed, and the list git gives is wider than the project: an agent's worktree copy, a nested clone, or an ignored build file named as changed would pull someone else's working state into the closure and inflate every token estimate calibrate compares; --since against a branch tip instead of the merge base would count what the branch never touched
  crossing: project-source -> reading
  refuted: let every path through without keepProjectFiles for paths on disk -> "working change: staged, unstaged, and untracked project files against HEAD, ..." went red in change.test.ts with an agent's worktree copy (.claude/worktrees/agent-x/src/api/render.ts) listed as added; restored, green (2026-09-23)
  kinds: none
- removal keeps its dependents: The files still importing a path the working change deleted, or the old path of a rename, enter the closure as that removal's dependents, and the spec of the component that held a deleted file enters with them.
  over: every deleted or renamed-away path of a working change, against every project source file importing it
  via: economy of the working change: the files still importing a deleted path or a renamed-away path enter the closure as its dependents, with the spec that held the deleted file
  because: a deleted file cannot be loaded or resolved, so hops through references find nothing for it, yet the files still naming it are exactly what the change broke; leaving them out would predict the smallest closure for the change most likely to need a wider one
  crossing: project-source -> reading
  refuted: skipped the scan for files importing a deleted or renamed-away path -> "economy of the working change: the files still importing a deleted path ..." went red in change.test.ts with src/api/uses-gone.ts missing from the closure; restored, green (2026-09-23)
  kinds: none
- a stop predicts for the session's own writes: The prediction a stop records is for the files the session's own tool uses wrote, that still exist, are the project's, and lie outside every folder the config ignores; another session's or a person's uncommitted change is never predicted for.
  over: a file the session wrote, a file someone else changed, a written file in an ignored folder, a written file since removed, and a session that wrote nothing
  via: a stop predicts for the session's own writes: never another session's or a person's uncommitted change, an ignored folder, or a file since removed
  because: the prediction is calibrate's estimate of what this session needed to read; predicting for the whole dirty tree compared a session against other people's edits, and on a checkout with uncommitted promo work it asked the language server about ignored files for 28 of a 37 s stop (df-ccecbb4a)
  refuted: let the session patch keep files in ignored folders -> "a stop predicts for the session's own writes: never another session's or a person's uncommitted change, an ignored folder, or a file since removed" went red in hook-speed.test.ts on its own assertion; restored byte for byte, green batched and alone (2026-10-06)
  kinds: none
- the prediction resolves only what a given file could define: A chokepoint invariant is resolved for the prediction only when a given file spells its protected or chokepoint name as a whole word, or is the module it names; a name no given file spells cannot be defined in one, so skipping it changes nothing the prediction finds.
  over: a symbol, a symbol in a file, a longer word containing the name, a module path given and not, and prose
  via: the prediction resolves a chokepoint invariant only when a given file spells its protected or chokepoint name, or is the module it names
  because: resolving every chokepoint invariant at every stop cost about two language-server requests each whatever the session wrote; the predictions before and after are identical on three file sets, two holding real chokepoints, and two to three and a half times faster
  refuted: matched a name anywhere in a given file's text, not as a whole word -> "the prediction resolves a chokepoint invariant only when a given file spells its protected or chokepoint name, or is the module it names" went red in hook-speed.test.ts on its own assertion; restored byte for byte, green batched and alone (2026-10-06)
  kinds: none
- mass counts every language: Mass of a multi-language project counts each declared language's source files, each read in its own language, and says which languages it read.
  over: the two-language fixture's Python and TypeScript files across two components
  via: mass of a two-language project counts every language's files and says which languages it read
  because: mass read the primary language alone, so a frontend's code was neither reached nor unreached and the report looked complete (df-f47a5c05)
  crossing: project-source -> reading
  refuted: made computeMass take the primary language's source files alone -> "mass of a two-language project counts every language's files and says which languages it read" went red in multi-language.test.ts on its own assertion; restored byte for byte, green batched and alone (2026-10-07)
