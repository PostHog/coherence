/**
 * The work store: where work orders live, how they are read back, and the
 * binding inference every journal write and every run goes through.
 *
 * One JSONL file per writing session under .coherence/work, append only,
 * with the journal's conventions: id, at, session, agent, commit, dirty. An
 * order is the fold of its records in time order: the order record sets the
 * content and the first owner; moves and the close set its state;
 * owner records move its owner. Nothing here grants or refuses anything: an
 * order is context, and the binding is how a reader finds everything one
 * assignment produced.
 *
 * Binding is inferred, never flagged by default: a session that owns exactly
 * one active order binds every record it writes to that order. A session
 * owning none or several binds nothing, and the record says which.
