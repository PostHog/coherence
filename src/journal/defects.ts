/**
 * Defects as a discovery that repays: each one carries its class, where it
 * came in and what caught it, and is closed by a resolution that either names
 * a guard for its whole class or cites a decision saying why fixing the
 * instance suffices.
 *
 * The fields are optional on every record, so a defect written before they
 * existed stays valid; the journal is append-only, so such a defect is
 * classified by a later decision (the classify verb), never edited. What a
 * defect's class, origin and catch are is folded here, oldest first: the
 * defect's own fields, then each classification of it, then its resolution;
 * a field given later overrides one given earlier, a retracted record gives
 * nothing, and a field nobody gave stays absent. Nothing is inferred.
 *
 * A class is declared once, as the property "class <name>" of the defect
 * concept in Coherence's lexicon or the project's own. A defect recorded in a
 * class that a resolution already guarded, after that guard, is a guard
 * failure: the protection was weaker than claimed. A family, declared as the
 * property "family <name>", is a class too broad for one guard (audience: a
 * reader told the wrong thing): each of its defects closes with its own guard
 * or a decision, and no guard of one stands for the rest, so a later defect
 * in a family is never a guard failure.
