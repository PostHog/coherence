/**
 * Scaffold entrances: the `## entrances` bullets for the detected entrances
 * no declared entrance covers (entrance-coverage.ts), in the spec grammar,
 * grouped by the component that owns each handler's file.
 *
 * Each bullet is one detected entrance: a name drawn from its symbol (a
 * route from its file's path under the routes folder, a script from its
 * file), the handler as the spec resolves it (`symbol in file`, the file
 * relative to the owning component; a file-grain entrance names its module),
 * and two placeholders only the agent can fill: the one-line meaning and the
 * trust level, listing the levels the entry spec declares. A placeholder
 * trust reads as absent, so an entrance pasted unfilled is still untrusted
 * and orient and regulate name it as a gap.
 *
 * Printed, never written: every bullet carries placeholders, and the
 * scaffold never writes one into a spec where a reader would take it for a
 * declaration (as control: none is never written with a placeholder reason).
